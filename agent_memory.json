      "answer": "**Inflation and the financial market \u2013 how the mechanism works**\n\n---\n\n### 1. What inflation is  \n\n*Inflation* is a sustained rise in the general price level of goods and services.

Direct channels through which inflation reaches the financial market  \n\n| Channel | How it operates | Typical market impact |\n|---------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **1. Real\u2011return erosion** | Investors compare the nominal return on an asset with the inflation rate. If inflation is higher than the nominal yield, the **real return becomes negative**.

Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing for corporations and households, which **tightens financial conditions**. | Bond yields rise, stock valuations fall (higher discount rates), and credit spreads widen. |\n| **3. Inflation risk premium** | When inflation expectations rise, investors demand a **higher compensation** for bearing that risk. The required return on all risky assets (stocks, corporate bonds) is adjusted upward. | Stock prices may drop because investors are willing to pay less for the same expected cash flows; bond prices fall as yields rise. |\n| **4. Redistribution of income and wealth** | Inflation erodes the real value of fixed\u2011income earnings (pensions, bonds) while benefiting borrowers whose debt is repaid with cheaper dollars. | Market participants may re\u2011balance portfolios\u2014selling nominal\u2011fixed\u2011income assets and buying inflation\u2011hedges. |\n| **5.
