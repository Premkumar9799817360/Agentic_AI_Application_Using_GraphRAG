  "text": "Global financial markets are dominated by exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Nvidia represent some of the largest market capitalizations in the world, exceeding trillions of US dollars collectively. These companies influence global liquidity, investor sentiment, and technological development trends. Stock performance is driven by factors such as revenue growth, profit margins, innovation, and market demand. Financial ratios including Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and Return on Assets (ROA) provide investors with insight into corporate performance. Macro-economic variables like interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve, inflation rates, and geopolitical events play a significant role in global market dynamics. Institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and sovereign wealth funds control large volumes of equity and debt instruments, influencing liquidity and pricing. Hedge funds and algorithmic trading firms also contribute to short-term volatility and price efficiency. Emerging trends such as AI-powered trading, ESG investing, and blockchain-based digital assets are reshaping global finance. Market monitoring authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US ensure investor protection and fair practices. Cross-market linkages mean that events in one region, like Federal Reserve rate hikes, can significantly impact stock prices in other regions, including India, China, and Europe.",
