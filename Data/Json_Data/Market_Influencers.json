  "text": "Global financial markets include equity exchanges like NASDAQ, NYSE, LSE, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Hong Kong Stock Exchange, supporting diverse multinational companies. Technology giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Samsung, Intel, and Alibaba lead global market capitalization, driving innovation and investor sentiment. Financial ratios including P/E, ROE, EPS, and Debt-to-Equity are standard tools for evaluating these companies. Macroeconomic variables such as US Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, inflation rates, global GDP growth, and geopolitical events influence stock prices worldwide. Institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity, and sovereign wealth funds, control significant shares of global equities, affecting liquidity, volatility, and long-term strategy. Hedge funds and algorithmic trading firms introduce high-frequency trading and arbitrage, increasing short-term market efficiency. ESG-focused investing has gained momentum, where investors evaluate environmental, social, and governance metrics alongside traditional financial ratios. Cross-market correlations are high: a policy change in the US or Europe can significantly affect emerging markets in India, China, and Southeast Asia. Regulatory authorities like the SEC, FCA, and MAS ensure transparency, investor protection, and adherence to trading rules. Financial news, economic indicators, and corporate filings are routinely analyzed to assess market trends, corporate valuation, and risk exposure for informed investment decisions.",
