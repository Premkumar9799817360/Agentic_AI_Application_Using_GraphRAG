  "text": "The Indian financial market consists of equity markets, debt markets, commodities, and derivatives. NSE and BSE are the main stock exchanges, hosting thousands of companies across multiple sectors. Large-cap companies like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, TCS, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, SBI, Bharti Airtel, Larsen & Toubro, and Asian Paints dominate market capitalization and trading volumes. Stock prices in India are influenced by corporate earnings, sectoral trends, macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and global financial conditions. Institutional investors, including mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign portfolio investors (FPI), significantly affect liquidity and price movement. Retail investor participation has increased due to digital trading platforms and mobile apps, improving market inclusivity. Financial ratios, such as P/E, ROE, Debt-to-Equity, EPS, and Net Profit Margin, are critical in evaluating companies' financial health and investment potential. Recent trends include algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading, and ESG investing, emphasizing sustainable growth. SEBI regulates exchanges to ensure transparency, enforce circuit breakers, monitor margin requirements, and prevent systemic risks. Sector-wise, IT, banking, energy, FMCG, and telecom dominate equity turnover. Investors often use predictive analytics, integrating macroeconomic data, company fundamentals, and financial ratios to forecast stock returns. The Indian market also interacts with global markets, as foreign inflows and geopolitical events can impact domestic equities. Companies with strong governance, consistent earnings, and low leverage are generally preferred by institutional investors for long-term holdings.",
