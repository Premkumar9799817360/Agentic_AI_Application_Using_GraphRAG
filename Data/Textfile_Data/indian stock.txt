The Indian stock market is one of the most active and rapidly growing equity markets in the world, encompassing thousands of companies that represent a wide range of industries and sectors. The stock market exists primarily through two major exchanges: the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), both located in Mumbai. Together, these exchanges allow companies to raise capital from the public by issuing shares, and they provide a marketplace where investors — both institutional and retail — can buy and sell ownership in these corporations. The Indian market has grown significantly over the years, with total market capitalization across listed companies reaching multi-trillion-dollar levels, reflecting broad economic expansion and investor participation.

The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), established in 1992, quickly became the country’s leading exchange due to its fully automated electronic trading system. The NSE introduced a uniform electronic platform known as the National Exchange for Automated Trading (NEAT), which enabled investors from across India to participate seamlessly in equity and derivative trading. As of 2025, the NSE is one of the largest stock exchanges in the world in terms of market capitalization and trading volume, hosting more than 2,600 listed companies. The exchange is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), ensuring transparency, investor protection, and fairness in market operations. Ownership of the exchange includes a consortium of financial institutions, banks, insurance companies, and foreign investors, with significant shareholders such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), State Bank of India (SBI), and New India Assurance among others.

In late 2025, the NSE also made news for its leadership appointment, naming Srinivas Injeti as its chairperson, closing a long vacancy and positioning the exchange toward future goals, including potential public listing plans that have been in discussion for several years. This leadership change is significant as it may influence strategic direction, governance reforms, and the exchange’s regulatory compliance in the future.

The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), founded in 1875, is Asia’s oldest stock exchange and one of the oldest in the world. It played a crucial role in the early development of the Indian capital markets long before electronic trading became standard. Today, the BSE is a demutualized and corporatized entity with a broad shareholder base. As of 2025, it lists over 5,500 companies, making it the largest exchange in India in terms of sheer number of listed firms. Despite this large number, many of these companies may be small- or mid-cap, and a smaller subset of them constitute the most traded and most closely followed stocks. The BSE’s benchmark index is the Sensex, which tracks 30 well-established and high-liquidity large-cap companies, representing a broad cross-section of the Indian economy. The BSE also offers a range of sectoral indices covering banks, consumer goods, healthcare, IT, and more. Sundararaman Ramamurthy serves as the Managing Director and CEO of BSE, overseeing operations and expansion of trading infrastructure, technology upgrades, and market services.

Whereas the NSE is known for high liquidity and dominance in derivatives trading, the BSE’s strength lies in its historical role as a comprehensive marketplace with a wide breadth of listings. Both exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which ensures standardized trading rules, surveillance mechanisms to prevent manipulation, and investor protections. Over the last decade, India’s combined equity market capitalization across both NSE and BSE has grown dramatically, reflecting accelerated economic activity and increased participation from domestic and foreign investors.

The Indian stock market is also influenced by broader financial trends, including mutual fund ownership of stocks listed on the NSE, which has recently reached record levels with domestic mutual funds owning approximately 10.6% of all NSE-listed companies. This shift suggests growing trust in Indian equities and expanding asset management industry influence.
